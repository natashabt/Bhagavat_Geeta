            -In Hinduism, "Bhagavan" is a term used to refer to 
            the Supreme Being or the Absolute Truth conceived as a personal god. 
            Bhagavan comes from the Sanskrit word "bhaga," meaning "fortune" or "wealth." 
            Bhagavan refers to the supreme controller, the origin of all beings or the source 
            of everything and comprises six opulences:
            <ol>
                <li>1.beauty </li>
                <li>2.wealth </li>
                <li>3.knowledge</li>
                <li>4.stength </li>
                <li>5.fame </li>
                <li>6.renunciation</li>
            </ol>
            From the Bhagavad Gita and other scriptures, we come to know that Lord Krishna, 
            the supreme personality of Godhead, possesses all the opulences in full. 
            He is the supreme controller and the origin of all beings.
