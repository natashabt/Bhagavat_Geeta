            The Bhagavad Gita deals with five subject matters which are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>1. Isvara (God)</li>
                <li>2. Jiva (living entity)</li>
                <li>3. kala (time)</li>
                <li>4. prakriti (nature)</li>
                <li>5. Karma (actions)</li>
            </ol>
            It is important to understand the subject matter of time (kƒÅla). 
            In order to give up our mundane attachments, and be fixed on the path of perfection,
            one must understand how the dynamics of this world are governed by time. time is another representation of god.
            so theere are yugs which corresndpionds to a period of time. so there four yugs:
            <ol>
                <li> 1. satya yug </li>
                <li> 2. trtaya yug </li>
                <li> 3. dupar yug </li>
                <li> 4. kali yug.</li>
            </ol>
            
            at present we are in kalyug which spans 432000 years and dupara yug is time span is twice that of kaliyug
            terya yug time span is twice that of dwapar yug and satya yug time span is twice that of tretya yug so the
            duration of human life span in kalyug is around 100 yrs maximum.so after kalyug ends then a devastration takes 
            place and again satyayug begins in this way there is a cycle of 4 yugas.
