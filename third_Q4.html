            Karma is a concept of Hinduism which describes a system in which beneficial effects are derived from past
            beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions
            throughout a soul's reincarnated lives, forming a cycle of rebirth. 
            There are three different types of karma: prarabdha, sanchita, and kriyamana or agami. 
            Prarabdha karma is experienced through the present body and is only a part of sanchita karma, 
            which is the sum of one's past karmas, whereas agami karma is the result of current decisions and actions.
            There are mainly 3 types of karma:
            <ol>
                <li>1.karma or prescribed duty</li>
                <li>2.vikarma or prohibited actions</li>
                <li>3.akarma or activities of devotion to god </li>
            </ol>
            by doing karma to get good results in this life and the next by doing the karma he suffers 
            in this life and then in hell , by doing a karma he becomes leberated and goes back to original
            place in the kingdom of god
