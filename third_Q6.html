            Karma is the law of cause and effect. Your actions (karma) in past lives 
            influence your present circumstances, including your birth. 
            If someone lived a life of charity and virtue (sattvic qualities) in a past life, 
            they might be born into a wealthy family to continue their spiritual pursuits. 
            The Srimad Bhagavatam emphasizes spiritual growth over material wealth.  
            Being born poor could be an opportunity to learn detachment and develop one's character
