            Krishna's advice in the Bhagavad-gita is that we tolerate this temporary suffering. 
            Just as your body is not permanent, so your diseases are also not permanent. 
            You should tolerate the temporary suffering and solve the real problem 
            you must stop your repetition of birth and death. But people do not know that 
            birth and death can be stopped, so they are simply busy with the temporary problems.
            by engaging in devotional service to god we can minimise the sorrow and suffering in life.
